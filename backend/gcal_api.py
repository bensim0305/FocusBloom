"""
File for communicated with the Google Calendar API. Functions here should be used for FocusBloom.
Functions to implement:
    - Schedule Task: based on parameters given by user, such as how long each wokr session would take, 
    when it is due, priority, name of task. These can for now be implemented through command line
        - Helper: look through calendar to find open timeslot
    - Reschedule Task: User can reschedule task to add on to next available day before due date
Data Structures: Should have a dictionary with task details so we can update accordingly with dates 
    to work on, length of how long it should take, etc. Should update whenever a task is finished
